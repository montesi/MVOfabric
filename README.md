# MVOfabric
 Display and characterize Melt Volume Orientation (MVO) fabric

 MVOauto0705 drives several other matlab scripts that:
 – Load a dataset of non-directed axes and save the information into CUBES.mat
 _ Determine density contours with a Watson distribution kernel and plot them on lower-hemisphere Schmidt projection
         _ The concentration parameter and the contour levels are calculated using algorithms described in Fisher et al. (1987) Statistical Analysis of Spherical Data, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0 521 24273 8
_ MOIdemo illustrate the definition of the moment of inertia of an arbitrary 3D melt volume.
_ It is possible to change from Watson to Fisher kernel (appropriate for directed axial data).

This package was used to analyze data and generate figures in Bader, J.A., W. Zhu, L. Montési, C. Qi, B. Cordonnier, D. Kohlstedt, & J. Warren, Effects of Stress-driven Melt Segregation on Melt Orientation, Melt Connectivity and Anisotropic Permeability, Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, DOI 10.1029/2023JB028065
